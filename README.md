## Feature summary
*The application is intended for healthcare facilities and will track patient blood panels.  This initial version has only a limited set of blood tests available (focusing on blood glucose and lipids) but can easily be expanded.  The healthcare facility using the application can enter patient information then associate labs to that patient.  Additionally, the application allows the user to analyze the patients blood tests against standard reference ranges to determine any outlyers which may require attention.*

*As the application stores personal health data it would need to be secured according to [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) guidelines.  This would require a user login and suficient network controls, which may include encrypting data at rest.  These features are not part of this initial version.*

*Below are key features of the application:*

+ Current patients are listed alphabetically
+ New patients can easily be added
